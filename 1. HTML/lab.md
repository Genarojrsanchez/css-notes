- Pick a site you really like (the more minimalist, the better)
    - if you're unsure, check out
        - https://www.awwwards.com/websites/minimal/
        - https://foundation.zurb.com/templates.html (these are a easier)
- Think about the content on the site and what tags it might use
- Create an HTML doc containing as much of the site content as possible, with what tags you think work best for the given content
- Open up your browser's dev tools and inspect the site's HTML, to see how they approached the content.
    - This varies depending on browser/operating system, so ask if you're not sure how to do this
