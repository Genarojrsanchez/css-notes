- Add some fonts to your site
- See if you can find a font that matches (somewhat closely) that of the original site's fonts
- Get them from
    - Google fonts
    - Some other font site site (e.g. font squirrel, my fonts, etc)
    - See if you can find and download or use the exact fonts that the website used
        - you'll need to peek around in the original site's HTML to figure that out
